# Unveiling the Rich and Diverse Universe of Subsecond Astrophysics through LSST Star Trails

We are preparing a [LSST Cadence Optimization White Paper](https://www.google.com) based on [Thomas and Kahn 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06977). The deadline is November 30th. I am hoping to recruit experts in the areas below to help bolster the respective science cases. Ideally, each expert would provide a single 4-6 sentence paragraph describing how LSST star trails and their improved time resolution will enhance their science.

| Topic | Committed Expert | Candidates |
|---|---|---|
|AGN/Blazars| Claudia Raiteri | Krista Lynne Smith|
|Solar System/Stars/Stellar Flars/KBOs| Željko Ivezić |Federica Bianco, Mario Zurić, Joachim Moeyens, Lynne Jones|
|Exoplanets| | Samantha Thrush, Nick Mondrik| 
|Gamma-ray Bursts | | Josh Bloom |
|Fast Radio Bursts | Andrea Possenti | David Thomas|
|Cataclysmic Variables|  | ? |

We will also be reaching out to individuals with expertise in domains that are relevant to this work.

| Topic | Candidates |
|---|---|
|NCSA + LSST Special Programs| M. L. Graham, Simon Krughoff, Eric Bellm|
|CatSim, PhoSim| Colin Burke, John Peterson, Scott Daniels|
|Star Trails| Steve Howell, George Jacoby, Robert Blum|

We also encourage those who are generally interested in this technique to get invovled (please email dthomas5[at]stanford.edu and we will get you on the author list). Not only will it be exciting to complete this proposal, but there are many areas we can investigate together moving forward.
