# Unveiling the Rich and Diverse Universe of Subsecond Astrophysics through LSST Star Trails

We submitted this white paper (StarTrailCadenceOptimization.pdf), based on [Thomas and Kahn 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06977), in response to the LSST call for [Cadence Optimization White Papers](https://www.google.com). Thank you to everyone below for contributing to this process. We also encourage others who are generally interested in this technique to reach out and get invovled (please email dthomas5[at]stanford.edu).
