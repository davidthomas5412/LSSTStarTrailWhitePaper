# Unveiling the Rich and Diverse Universe of Subsecond Astrophysics through LSST Star Trails

We are preparing a [LSST Cadence Optimization White Paper](https://www.google.com) based on [Thomas and Kahn 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06977). The deadline is November 30th. We encourage those who are generally interested in this technique to get invovled (please email dthomas5[at]stanford.edu). 

*Latest news:* we completed the abstract/science justification.

 TODO:
- redo performance section.
- review constraints.
- Processing section: For blazar science case we would want rapid, on-site processing.
